A low privileged User for example a Developer or a public user who is able to create surveys is able to insert malicious javascript code into the web application. The results of surveys can be reviewd by an administrator in his web interface under Reports > Surveys. The malicious Javascript code gets there executed as well. Concrete5 does have a CSRF protection which can be bypassed very easily by stealing the corresponding Token from the Page before executing a Request. As concrete5 does not ask for the old password when changing it. It is possible to change the administrator password very easily.
